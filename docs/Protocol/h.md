At the physical layer we have media, cables, and connectors.

There are two groups of physical standards, the first increments as 2x and are called the Base2 standards. Each new standard must maintain backwards compatibility with the two previous standards. Long term compatibility is important, and the general feeling is that equipment will have a ten to twelve year lifetime before it is no longer useable with new equipment.

The second group increments as 10x and are called the Base10 standards and these maintain compatibility with the previous standard only.

As usual, you are guaranteed my notes will be out of date the day after I write them! Do check with an [authoritative source](https://fibrechannel.org/) for the latest information.

Fibre channel assumes a very high-quality physical layer, with a bit error rate (BER) of no greater than one in every 1012 bits. The implication is that you will not pass the traffic over a WAN. The physical layer may use copper of fibre connections.
